# Photography_Database_and_Operating_System

<h2>Project Description</h2>
This project involves creating and implementing a database system. In Part A, entities are identified, business rules are created, and an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is logically constructed using Visual Paradigm. The ERD must include all attributes, primary and foreign keys, named relationships, cardinality, and participation, and resolve many-to-many relationships. In Part B, tables are created in Oracle SQL Developer using the ERD as a guide. This includes defining attributes, constraints and populating tables with sample data. Lastly, Part C requires creating five SQL queries that satisfy particular data retrieval criteria while showcasing understanding of SQL clauses and features.

<h2>Paired Project Distribution:</h2>
As this was a paired assignment, we needed to ensure even work distribution. In order to achieve this productively, we decided to discuss our strengths. Based on our strengths, we assigned each other specific tasks. I had a better understanding of Part A, so I fully completed that. Whereas, Part B and C were completed collectively.
